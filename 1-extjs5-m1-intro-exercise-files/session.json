It contains robust implementations\nof WebSocket, Batch, JSON, Concurrency, JMS2, JAX-RS 2, CDI 1.1, and\nall Java EE 7 technologies. Undertow is the new cutting-edge web\nserver in WildFly 8 and is designed for maximum throughput and\nscalability, including environments with over a million connections.\nThe number of ports is reduced by multiplexing protocols over HTTP\nusing HTTP Upgrade.\n\nRole Based Access Control support organizations with separated\nmanagement responsibilities and restrictions. Roles represent\ndifferent sets of permissions such as runtime operation execution,\nconfiguration areas that can read or written, and the ability to audit\nchanges and manage users. In addition a new restricted audit log can\nbe enabled including the ability to offload to a secure syslog server.\nIt also provides a rich web-based administration console and a\npowerful CLI for management. Multi instance cluster with high\navailability can be easily created.\n\nYou don't even need to download WildFly in order to experience this\nfunctionality. Applications can be directly deployed to OpenShift, Red\nHat's open source PaaS offering.\n\nThis session will provide an overview of all these features using\nseveral live demos.",

From there I will demonstrate how easy it is to run a WebSocket enabled application that provides live tracking map of airplane flights. The code will be a mix of JavaScript, Java, and Python to flex some polyglotness. Then with a few lines of code I will demonstrate how easy it is to push the same feed of data straight into a spatially enabled MongoDB instance.

This is an important enabler for systems that use auto scaling patterns. We have built an abstraction interface on top of several cache providers we evaluated. This gives us a common model for analyzing performance data, like TPS. We open sourced some of this work into a library called CacheSharp (on Github and NuGet). In this session we’ll show you how we run tests against several providers, establish a baseline of data, and compare the results.

Agile thrives with individual teams, yet even Ken Schwaber asserts 75% of organizations using scrum won't succeed in getting the benefits they hope for from it.

A set of established and emerging ideas to address organizational impediments point to a future where Agile introductions Go Big, rather than Go Home.

The shared Windows and Windows Phone Runtime solves this question with a simple app lifecycle that suspends unused apps. The user’s foreground experience has prioritized CPU, memory, and network bandwidth. It’s a solution similar to other mobile platforms. But, as a developer, what if you need to execute code even when your app is suspended or not running? Introducing the Background Task, a core part of the Windows Runtime framework. Background Tasks can update your live tile, geofence, synchronize data, or do whatever your apps needs to do in order to create value. This session introduces the Background Task infrastructure & underpinnings, implementation techniques, common mistakes, and general best practices.

Over the last decade, I’ve worked with companies ranging from software, financials, to media and entertainment. Solving scale problems with leading innovations in the tech space has been an area of interest to me. From building APIs at E*Trade, IGN, and Netflix I’ve evolved both as a leader as well as an engineer focused on scalable yet flexible, and highly performant architectures.\n\nCurrently I am working at Netflix as an Engineering Manager in the Streaming Platforms group, where my team builds APIs and tools around device data and partner products. Prior to Netflix I was Director of Engineering at IGN.com, where I helped build the next-gen API for the social and content platforms.\n\nFollow me @lobster1234 on Twitter, and linkedin.com/in/mpandit on LinkedIn",

Before I joined Microsoft in 2011, I was active in the local open source community.  I discovered functional programming through Scala, which I enjoyed very much.  At a Silicon Valley Code Camp in 2008, I had a break in my schedule and decided to attend a talk on F# by Tim Ng of Microsoft.  At that time, I didn't even own a Windows computer and had only heard faint whispers about F#.  By the end of Tim's talk, I was sold.  F# really clicked with me.  I stopped what I was doing, switched my home machine from Solaris to Windows, and dove into F# and .NET.  I soon learned that to really become an expert in .NET, you have to know C#, which I then picked up and enjoyed just as much.  I tossed VB.NET in for good measure.  After joining Microsoft, I expanded on the C++ skills I used in my interest in scientific computing.",

Before I joined Microsoft in 2011, I was active in the local open source community.  I discovered functional programming through Scala, which I enjoyed very much.  At a Silicon Valley Code Camp in 2008, I had a break in my schedule and decided to attend a talk on F# by Tim Ng of Microsoft.  At that time, I didn't even own a Windows computer and had only heard faint whispers about F#.  By the end of Tim's talk, I was sold.  F# really clicked with me.  I stopped what I was doing, switched my home machine from Solaris to Windows, and dove into F# and .NET.  I soon learned that to really become an expert in .NET, you have to know C#, which I then picked up and enjoyed just as much.  I tossed VB.NET in for good measure.  After joining Microsoft, I expanded on the C++ skills I used in my interest in scientific computing.",

You have to worry about resources, collections of resources, pagination, query parameters, references to other resources, which HTTP Methods to use, HTTP Caching, security, and more!  And you have to make sure it lasts and doesn't break clients as you add features over time. Further, while there are many references on creating REST APIs with XML, there are much fewer references for REST + JSON.\n\nIn this presentation, Les Hazlewood - Stormpath CTO and Apache Shiro PMC Chair - will share all of the golden nuggets learned while designing, implementing and supporting JSON-based REST APIs, using examples from a clean real-world REST+JSON API.  He will cover:\n\n* JSON-based data formats in a RESTful API\n* References to other JSON-based resources (aka 'linking').\n* Resource collections and pagination\n* How to map (and how not to map) HTTP methods to Resource CRUD\n* Resource partial updates\n* Supporting HTTP Method Overloading for clients that don't support HTTP PUT and DELETE\n* API versioning strategies\n* Meaningful Error responses\n* Many-to-many resource relationships\n* HTTP Caching and Optimistic concurrency control.\n* Authentication and Security\n",

We’ll start with “What is the problem we are trying to solve?” and discuss alternatives, acknowledge the challenges associated with exception usage, and cover some well-meaning but misguided attempts at safety. I will then present a set of guidelines that are the basis for safe exception usage and solid implementation techniques, including how to transition from an exception-unsafe legacy code base.\n\nWhen we are finished you will know how to produce code that is easier to write, easier to understand, faster, and 100% robust in the face of exceptions.",

If you have fear, uncertainty, or doubt about exception safety or just want to see the best practices for using exceptions in C++, this session is for you. We’ll start with “What is the problem we are trying to solve?” and discuss alternatives, acknowledge the challenges associated with exception usage, and cover some well-meaning but misguided attempts at safety. I will then present a set of guidelines that are the basis for safe exception usage and solid implementation techniques, including how to transition from an exception-unsafe legacy code base.\n\nWhen we are finished you will know how to produce code that is easier to write, easier to understand, faster, and 100% robust in the face of exceptions.",

GameMaker Studio is also advanced enough for seasoned game developers to build games for desktops, web (HTML5),  and Android & iOS mobile devices.\n\nIn this hands-on tutorial, you will be introduced to GameMaker Studio drag and drop functionality to build an arcade game, with brief exposure to scripting.  In the process, you will learn how to create a \"game plan\", identifying the game assets and objects, and designing behaviors and interactions.  I will also mention the advantages of GameMaker over other game development environments such as Stencyl,  GameSalad, Construct 2, and Unity.\n\nIf you'd like to do the exercise, please  bring a Windows laptop or a Mac with Windows on a Virtual Machine or Bootcamp.

Video games are extremely popular on smart phones and tablets. While the odds are against your game becoming a smash hit, is still possible to make a fun game which generates a bit of money via direct sales or in-game advertising. \n\nIn this three part session we will explore using Cocos2d-x, an open source game engine, to build games for all three major smart phone platforms - Android, Apple, and Microsoft. Unlike other game engines, Cocos2d-x is not only free, it runs on multiple platforms giving you the ability to port your game not only to the most popular phone platforms but to desktop platforms like Windows and Mac OS X.\n",

With so many database-driven projects for consumer desktop software applications, websites and enterprise software systems, the database design plays a crucial role in the success of your project. You'll see real-life examples and issues such as: Creating a new table; Choosing data types; Normalization (and when to denormalize); Types of relationships; Referential integrity; Join/relationship tables; 1-to-many, many-to-many; How to actually use these structures in your application; While the examples will focus on SQL Server, the techniques and SQL code will work for virtually any SQL database.

We will then examine the two models of the Rubik's cube: first using object oriented programming and then using functional programming just to get a feel of these two techniques. We will also discuss some algorithms to find useful moves by simple search mechanism enhanced with Rubik's cube common sense. Join us if you are new to JavaScript, have interest in Rubik's cube or just want to have some fun with programming.\nFor those who attended this session last year, you will like the new features in Java Script and an introduction to Functional Programming.  I promise we will have some fun time with the Rubik’s cube too.\n",

In this session we will be using the Java programming language to write simple algorithms that power windmills, drive cars, and draw pictures.  Students will get a chance to build projects from scratch with Lego bricks, deploy and run Java on the Mindstorms Intelligent Brick, and edit Java code on their laptops to make improvements to the projects.  Lego Mindstorms hardware will be supplied for use during the lab; however, students will receive a printed project guide and are encouraged to continue exploring and learning at home.",

We will describe how you use them to process collections in Java and Scala. You will learn how functional Futures and Rx (Reactive Extensions) Observables simplify concurrent code.

After Intuit, Jeff helped found an engineering department at a small visual design company to build C++ class libraries for highly customized user interfaces. During the late 1990s he was a founding engineer at an online recruiting startup and helped create a two way job seeker to employer matching algorithm and job invitation system. In 2003, he joined PayCycle which was acquired by Intuit in 2009. He served as lead architect for the online payroll platform and oversaw many huge transformations like creating an API for payroll and the first version IOP Mobile. He played a key role in successfully merging the Intuit payroll engineering organization with the PayCycle organization and transforming the platform into one that generates $150 million in revenue. Jeff currently is a Principal Engineer for the QuickBooks Ecosystem focused mostly on enabling teams to build plugins.",

After Intuit, Jeff helped found an engineering department at a small visual design company to build C++ class libraries for highly customized user interfaces. During the late 1990s he was a founding engineer at an online recruiting startup and helped create a two way job seeker to employer matching algorithm and job invitation system. In 2003, he joined PayCycle which was acquired by Intuit in 2009. He served as lead architect for the online payroll platform and oversaw many huge transformations like creating an API for payroll and the first version IOP Mobile. He played a key role in successfully merging the Intuit payroll engineering organization with the PayCycle organization and transforming the platform into one that generates $150 million in revenue. Jeff currently is a Principal Engineer for the QuickBooks Ecosystem focused mostly on enabling teams to build plugins.",

            "description": "In this presentation (and a live demonstration) you will see why Reactive Extensions (Rx) is a powerful technology for asynchronous stream processing. RTI Data Distribution Service (DDS) will be used as the source of data and as a communication channel for asynchronous data streams. On top of DDS, we'll use Rx to subscribe, observe, project, filter, aggregate, merge, zip, and correlate one or more data streams (Observables). The live demo will be very visual as bouncing shapes of different colors will be transformed in front of you using C# lambdas, Rx.NET, and LinqPad. You will also learn about the new Rx4DDS.NET library that integrates RTI DDS with Rx.NET. Rx and DDS are a great match because both are reactive. Rx is based on the subject-observer pattern, which is quite analogous to the publish-subscribe pattern of DDS. When used together they support distributed dataflows seamlessly. If time permits, we will touch upon advanced Rx concepts such as stream of streams (IGroupedObservable) and how it captures DDS \"keyed topics\". The DDS applications using Rx4DDS.NET dramatically simplify concurrency to the extent that it can be simply configured. Sounds too good to be true? Listen to the talk and watch the demo.",

He splits his days between building tools and platform APIs for Atlassian's developer ecosystem and blogging or speaking about developer tools, API design and building hackable products. \n \nTim also claims the first commit to Stash, Atlassian's enterprise Git repository management tool. His time on Stash taught him more about Git than is probably healthy, and he enjoys regularly speaking and blogging about Git arcanery.\n \nBeyond his day job, Tim enjoys hacking on Android games and 3D graphics. His current pet project is a libgdx-powered arcade-style shooter that he hopes to release to critical acclaim later this year (although this is the 3rd year he's said that).",

The resulting application specific operating system (ASOS) has strengthened security, increased reliability, lower hardware costs, reduced debug time, and minimized memory footprint, all of which are critical to devices connected to the Internet of Things.",

First we will explore the fashion industry, as a system for producing and distributing clothing and accessories.  Then the speaker will cover aspects of modernization & globalization including eco-innovation, crowdsourcing and pre-tailing. This section will end by offering “insider hints” highlighting how to collaborate with a fashion company.\n\nSecond we will cover advanced technologies used to build wearable fashion with an overview of MEMS (motion, position, environmental and capture) sensors and wireless (NFC, Bluetooth 4.0) connectivity used to build wearable fashion with code samples (iOS & Android) capturing physiological data. We will review of the current wearable market (eg. Nike Fuelband, Shine, Lark, Fitbit, Bodybug & Google - Glass / Moto / Ara).  This section will provide a real world example of placing Bluetooth 4.0 connected MEMS devices into a shoe which will lead to some surprising capabilities (telling us how to exercise properly).  This section will conclude by exploring this final thought.   “If it looks amazing and does not work well people will forgive but if it works great and it is ugly, no one will wear it.”\n\nThe talk will culminate by showing how these two industries will co-evolve and the different forms these collaborations can take. Their growth will now come from radically new products that combine the best that these two industries can offer. \n",

It can do everything Java, C/C++/C#, Ruby, PHP, and Perl can do, but it's also fun & intuitive! Enjoy coding as fast as you think with a simple yet robust syntax that encourages group collaboration. It is known for several popular web frameworks, including Django (Python's equivalent to Ruby on Rails), Pyramid, and web2py. There is also Google App Engine, where Python was the first supported runtime. Users supporting Zope, Plone, Trac, and Mailman will also benefit from knowing some Python. Python can do XML/ReST/XSLT, multithreading, SQL/databases, GUIs, hardcore math/science, Internet client/server systems & networking (heard of Twisted?), GIS/ESRI, QA/test, automation frameworks, plus system administration tasks too! On the education front, it's a great tool to teach programming with (especially those who have done Scratch or Tynker already) as well as a solid (first) language to learn for non-programmers and other technical staff. Finally, if Python doesn't do what you want, you can extend it in C/C++, Java, or C# (even VB.NET)! Have you noticed the huge growth in the number of jobs on Monster & Dice that list Python as a desired skill? Come find out why Google, Yahoo!, Disney, Cisco, YouTube, LinkedIn, Yelp, LucasFilm/ILM, Pixar, NASA, Ubuntu, Bank of America, and Red Hat all use Python!",

Python can do XML/ReST/XSLT, multithreading, SQL/databases, GUIs, hardcore math/science, Internet client/server systems & networking (heard of Twisted?), GIS/ESRI, QA/test, automation frameworks, plus system administration tasks too! On the education front, it's a great tool to teach programming with (especially those who have done Scratch or Tynker already) as well as a solid (first) language to learn for non-programmers and other technical staff. Finally, if Python doesn't do what you want, you can extend it in C/C++, Java, or C# (even VB.NET)! Have you noticed the huge growth in the number of jobs on Monster & Dice that list Python as a desired skill? Come find out why Google, Yahoo!, Disney, Cisco, YouTube, LinkedIn, Yelp, LucasFilm/ILM, Pixar, NASA, Ubuntu, Bank of America, and Red Hat all use Python!",

However, with great power also comes great power to do things incorrectly, which leads to many projects based on XAML technologies that are in trouble in some way. In this session Markus will take a look at XAML Anti-Patterns – common solutions that end up being ineffective and counterproductive. Among the discussed patterns and techniques are things like bootstrappers, virtualization, resources, XAML itself, and much, much more. Many of the presented topics may surprise even advanced XAML developers.\n\n",

            "description": "Surviving as a zombie is tough...  with the constant risks of sunlight, fire, and pesky mobs, doing your job of infecting the local villagers can be deadly.  Fortunately, with the new JavaFX ZombieTime app, powered by the JSR 310 Date and Time API, you can rest easy.  With built-in time zone and DST support you no longer have to worry about roaming around under the scorching hot sun.  Accurately calculate out how long you have to infect the villagers before you decompose using Durations.  And coordinate global attacks on the humans by syncing with your undead brethren on Instants.  With the power of Java 8, eradicating the human race with a highly infectious virus has never been easier!\n\nThis presentation is designed to teach Java Date and Time APIs to the undead, but the living are welcome to be our \"guests\".  You may also learn some JavaFX in the process -- that is entirely my fault.  Any correlation between the characters and events in this presentation and the impending extinction of mankind is purely coincidental.",
